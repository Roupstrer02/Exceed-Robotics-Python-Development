# Learning objectives: python overview, data types, variables, data conversion, inputs, printing
#===============================================================================

#===============================================================================
# Group exercise:
#===============================================================================

#go through each print as a separate example. Delete the previous one and write the new one each time

#print is a command that shows a message in the terminal, that message is whatever is put inside the ()
print("Hello World!")

#it can print words and numbers too
print(123)

#we'll take a closer look at this later but know that when you write a math expression anywhere in your code
#the computer will first find the answer to that expression, and then use the result.
print(5+5)
print(5-5)
print(5*5)
print(5/5)
print("Hello " + "World" + " Once" + " Again!")

x = "Hello there!"
print(x)

# Note how this example pretty much does exactly what we will ask of them in the task repeatedly
y = input("What's your favorite food? ")
print("Oh wow, I love " + y + " too!")
